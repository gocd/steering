## Notes:

  - Main topic for the day: A deeper understanding of different software foundations which could be a neutral home for GoCD.

  - Foundations which came up during the discussion:

    - [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/)
      - Apache Incubator program: [https://incubator.apache.org/cookbook/](https://incubator.apache.org/cookbook/)
      - Incubator FAQ: [https://incubator.apache.org/faq.html](https://incubator.apache.org/faq.html)

    - [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/)
      - FAQ: [https://www.cncf.io/about/faq/\#what-is-cloud-native](https://www.cncf.io/about/faq/#what-is-cloud-native)
      - [CNCF Project Proposal Process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/project_proposals.adoc)
      - CNCF [project proposal due diligence guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/due-diligence-guidelines.md)
      - Tomasz said: "As a side note: For infra CNCF is [using AWS promotional credits for open-source projects](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/aws-makes-it-rain-extends-credits-to-open-source-projects/2019/10/) which is something that GoCD might be eligible for once fully open source."

    - [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)
      - [This page](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/hosting/), especially starting from [this section](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/hosting/#assist) does a good job of explaining the role of the Linux Foundation. They are quite hands off, but help set up structures in place to help with fundraising, etc.

    - [CD Foundation](https://cd.foundation/)
      - [Foundation's FAQ](https://github.com/cdfoundation/faq)
      - [Project lifecycle process](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/blob/master/PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md) to be inducted into the foundation.
      - [Services provided by the CDF to projects](https://cd.foundation/project-services/)

    - [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/)
      - [Project handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#starting)
      - [Rudimentary build infrastructure](https://wiki.eclipse.org/CBI) is provided, and can be enhanced by [supporting (paid member) organisations](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/become_a_member/membershipTypes.php).

    - [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/)
      - Services: [https://sfconservancy.org/projects/services/](https://sfconservancy.org/projects/services/)
      - Current projects: [https://sfconservancy.org/projects/current/](https://sfconservancy.org/projects/current/)
      - Applying to be a part of the conservancy: [https://sfconservancy.org/projects/apply/](https://sfconservancy.org/projects/apply/)
      - More around fund-raising than acting as a foundation.

    - There were others such as the FSF, Python Software Foundation, OpenJS Foundation, that are not really applicable to GoCD.

  - A recurring theme was a need for understanding what kind of support around build infrastructure would be provided by the foundations. That's the largest continuing cost of GoCD operations currently.

  - Reading between the lines, a lot of these foundations prefer significant diversity of commenters and contributors to the project. Some, like the Apache foundation make it clear that the project, once it becomes a part of the foundation, cannot be influenced by any contributor or set of contributors (that's good). It's a meritocracy (mentioned in the Apache handbook specifically) and anyone who contributes enough will be able to influence the direction.

  - Governance: Not all foundations are prescriptive about _how_ the project should be run. Some are hands-off and some recommend setting up steering committees.

  - Another point that was brought up: Since we are thinking about the project in a free-software-open-source kind of model ... from the perspective of growing the community, it is better if GoCD can be part of a foundation that fits that model (primarily practitioner driven) than a foundation which is primarily vendor driven.

  - Talked briefly about the fact that there seems to be no middle ground between foundations and leaving a project to fend for itself on GitHub. Mark brought up the fact that he has seen an interesting model in some projects recently, where features are released earlier to those who backed projects. This is called "sponsorware", and an example of this approach [can be seen here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/). In a way, organisations "subscribe" for features to be built. One advantage of being part of a foundation rather than being independent is the guidance and the frameworks available that have already been proven to work well.

  - **ACTION ITEM**: Create a one-pager about GoCD, its history and its story, so that we can use it to start a conversation with a subset of the foundations identified, to understand what is possible.
