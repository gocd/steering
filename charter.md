# GoCD steering committee charter (bootstrapping)

## Overview

This document describes the bootstrapping process for the GoCD Steering Committee. It describes the formation of the initial steering committee and its core responsibilities. This includes its governance processes and processes to reform itself as necessary.

## Goals

The initial roles of the bootstrap steering committee are:
1. To decide on a longer-term home for GoCD as a fully open-source project.
2. To instantiate the formal process for GoCD governance.

## Scope

The bootstrap steering committee has a set of rights and responsibilities including the following:

- Recommend actions regarding GoCD's assets to ThoughtWorks, Inc. ("ThoughtWorks") (the current holder of these assets), including codebases (across GitHub organizations: gocd, gocd-contrib and others), domain names (such as gocd.org, go.cd, gocd.io, etc), trademarks and licenses.

- Define and evolve project governance structures and policies, including those that address contributions, maintainers, approvers, reviewers, etc., towards a longer-term technical steering committee for GoCD.

- Define a process for setting up a technical steering committee (possibly elected), including terms and procedures.

## Committee Structure

### Establishment

To bootstrap GoCD's longer-term steering, five individuals (Ashwanth Kumar, Birgitta Boeckeler, Ketan Padegaonkar, Mark Crossfield and Tomasz SÄ™tkowski) have been identified to be on the bootstrap steering committee. This committee will be time-bound and will dissolve once its goals are achieved.

### Vacancies

In the event of a resignation or other loss of a bootstrap steering committee member, ThoughtWorks will identify a new member to be a part of the committee.

### Refactoring or reforming the steering committee

At any time this committee may decide, via majority vote, to rewrite or remove any part of this charter, such changes will only take effect upon ThoughtWorks' written approval. Beyond small tweaks, this should be used sparingly, if ever, and in the presence of clear failures of the process. There is, explicitly, no role for the broader community in reformulating governance. The belief is that, in such a case, the community will "vote with their feet" by either leaving or forking the project.

### Bootstrap steering committee meetings

Regular steering committee meetings will be held, at least once a month. The entire committee is generally expected to attend every meeting, but quorum is met with a simple majority attendance. Meeting notes will be made publicly available in a timely manner.

Meetings without publicly available notes or redacted notes are reserved for confidential matters only. The broader community will be informed if this has happened, with general reasons for this.
